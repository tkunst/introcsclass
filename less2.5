### Next Day procedure

###
### Define a simple nextDay procedure, that assumes
### every month has 30 days.
###
### For example:
###    nextDay(1999, 12, 30) => (2000, 1, 1)
###    nextDay(2013, 1, 30) => (2013, 2, 1)
###    nextDay(2012, 12, 30) => (2013, 1, 1)  (even though December really has 31 days)
###

def nextDay(year, month, day):
    """
    Returns the year, month, day of the next day.
    Simple version: assume every month has 30 days.
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    if day == 30 and month == 12:
        year = year+1
    if month<12 and day==30:
        month = month + 1   
    if month == 12 and day==30:
        month = 1
    if day<30:
        day = day + 1
    if day == 30:
        day=1
    
    return year, month, day

#udacity answer
def nextDay(year, month, day):
  if day<30:
    return year, month, day+1
    else:
      if month<12:
      return year, month+1, 1
      else:
        return year+1, 1, 1
        
# test cases
print nextDay(1999,12,30)
print nextDay(2013,1,30)
print nextDay(2012,12,30)
print nextDay(2012,1,1)
print nextDay(2012,12,1)
