#Lesson 2.5 Udacity class Fall 2016

### Next Day procedure

###
### Define a simple nextDay procedure, that assumes
### every month has 30 days.
###
### For example:
###    nextDay(1999, 12, 30) => (2000, 1, 1)
###    nextDay(2013, 1, 30) => (2013, 2, 1)
###    nextDay(2012, 12, 30) => (2013, 1, 1)  (even though December really has 31 days)
###

def nextDay(year, month, day):
    """
    Returns the year, month, day of the next day.
    Simple version: assume every month has 30 days.
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    if day == 30 and month == 12:
        year = year+1
    if month<12 and day==30:

    if month == 12 and day==30:
        month = 1

        day = day + 1
    if day == 30:

##Nested inverse of correct way??

# correct output if there was a correct nextDay procedure.

# Note that this will NOT produce correct outputs yet, since
# our nextDay procedure assumes all months have 30 days
# (hence a year is 360 days, instead of 365).

#####assertion for invalid input

# happen when date 1 is not before date 2?
#
# Add an assertion to the code for daysBetweenDates to give
# an assertion failure when the inputs are invalid. This should
# occur when the first date is not before the second date.
