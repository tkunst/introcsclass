#################################Nested Lists

# Given the variable countries defined as:


#             Name      Capital  Populations (millions)
countries = [['China','Beijing',1350],
             ['India','Delhi',1210],
             ['Romania','Bucharest',21],
             ['United States','Washington',307]]

# What multiple of Romania's population is the population
# of China? Calculate this by accessing the list and
# dividing the population of China (1350)
# by the population of Romania (21).
# Please print your result.

#print countries[1][1] == Delhi

print countries[0][2]/countries[2][2]

#### Nest Mutation ##

# We defined:

stooges = ['Moe','Larry','Curly']

# but in some Stooges films, Curly was
# replaced by Shemp.
stooges [2]='Shemp'
# Write one line of code that changes
# the value of stooges to be:

['Moe','Larry','Shemp']

# but does not create a new List
# object.

####################### Aliasing

# Define a procedure, replace_spy,
# that takes as its input a list of
# three numbers, and modifies the
# value of the third element in the
# input list to be one more than its
# previous value.

spy = [0,0,7]


def replace_spy(spy):
    spy[2]=spy[2]+1







# In the test below, the first line calls your 
# procedure which will change spy, and the 
# second checks you have changed it.
# Uncomment the top two lines below.

replace_spy(spy)
print spy
#>>> [0,0,8]

####################Memory Notes

#1 byte = 8 bits
# bit is binary value - 0 or 1
# kilobyte = 2**10 #2 to power 10 = 1024 just over thousand bytes
# megabyte = 2**20 #2 to power 20 = 1,048,576 just over million bytes
# gigabyte = 2**30 #1,073,741,824 just over billion bytes
# terabyte = 2**40 # just over trillion bytes

# DRAM is a capacitor, storing bits temporarily until power goes off
# Registers is fastest type of memory built into CPU itself

#Distinguish types of memory by latency
#DRAM latency is 12nanoseconds
# nanosecond is a billionth of a second

#memory cost varies by latency and amount you can store
